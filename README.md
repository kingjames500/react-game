# React + Vite

# Rock Paper Scissors in React

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using React. The application allows users to play the game against the computer, showcasing the power and simplicity of React for building interactive user interfaces.

## Advantages of Using React

### Component-Based Architecture
React's component-based architecture allows for reusable UI components, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.

### Virtual DOM
React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance. This ensures that only the necessary parts of the DOM are updated, leading to faster and more efficient updates.

### State Management
React's state management makes it easy to manage and update the state of the application, leading to a more predictable and bug-free codebase.

### Ecosystem and Community
React has a vast ecosystem and a large community, providing a wealth of libraries, tools, and resources to enhance development.
